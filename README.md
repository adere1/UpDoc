# UpDoc
Creating an environment where doctors and patients can interact. Moreover, the patient can interact with the hospital/Healthcare provider via a portal where he has the freedom to pick a doctor, appointment and choose from a range of supported nearby hospitals.

Project Ideas:
  => Allows Doctors and Hospital staff to manage patients more efficiently.
  => Doctors  can view patientâ€™s complete history.
  => Hospital Staff can perform activities like add and link patient ,  search patient  etc.
  => Patients can book an appointment with reason , description and view his/her medical records.
  => All users can view list of nearby  hospitals, pharmacies and emergency contact numbers.
